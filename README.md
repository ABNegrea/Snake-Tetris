# Snake-Tetris
My first C# project at the age of 17. An application that features my own interpretation of the classic games Snake and Tetris

The app was made in order to earn my Certificate in Informatics in High School. It allows users to save their high scores (using MDB). While some of the code I wrote may have been messy, it was a reflection of my eagerness to learn and my drive to solve problems and explore new things.
